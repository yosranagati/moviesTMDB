This is a task project for Algorithmz

in this Project I used some CocoPod libraries to help me as follow 

1- Alamofire : an HTTP networking library to help in connecting to API 
2- SwiftyJSON : to help in dealing with JSon 
3- Groot : to help in saving objects from Json to core data
4 - SVProgressHUD : to count progress - has not been used unfortunately.
